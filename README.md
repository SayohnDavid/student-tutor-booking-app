# Student Tutor Booking App

## Project Overview
The Student Tutor Booking App is an Android-based application designed to streamline the
process of scheduling tutoring sessions between students and tutors. The app provides a
centralized platform where users can manage availability, bookings, and user access in a
simple and organized way.

This project was developed as part of a University of Ottawa software engineering course
and completed by a team of 6 students over a semester-long development period.
